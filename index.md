Hello, I am Sumyeong Ahn, a Postdoctoral Fellow at MSU collaborating with Prof. Jiayu Zhou. I obtained my Ph.D. from KAIST under the guidance of Prof. Se-Young Yun (KAIST AI) and Yung Yi (KAIST EE). My research has centered on creating dependable AI solutions across diverse AI domains. In particular, my previous work delved into addressing issues like dataset bias, noisy labels, and class imbalances. Lately, I've embarked on a study of multi-modality, exploring various modalities such as Graph-Language, Visual-Language, and Sound-Language models.
